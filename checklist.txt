Checklist for Building the RAG System

Planning and Setup
Define project scope (MVP with 1–3 articles).
Create a GitHub repository for hosting the project.
Set up a virtual environment for Python.

Knowledge Base
Select 1–3 high-quality articles as the knowledge base.
Convert the articles into a retrievable format (e.g., text or embeddings).

Data Processing
Tokenize and preprocess the articles.
Generate embeddings using an open-source library like sentence-transformers.

Backend
Set up a retrieval pipeline using a library like Haystack or LangChain.
Implement the RAG workflow, combining retrieval and generation.

Frontend GUI
Use a framework like Flet or Gradio to create a simple question-and-answer interface.
Design input fields for queries and display answers.

Ollama Integration
Research and integrate Ollama if available for Python.
Ensure compatibility with the retrieval pipeline.

Dockerization
Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
Test the container locally for smooth deployment.

Documentation
Write a detailed README with setup and usage instructions.
Include system architecture, examples, and future improvement plans.

Testing and Iteration
Test the system for basic functionality with the MVP setup.
Collect feedback and note improvements for future iterations.

Deployment
Prepare for deployment (local or cloud-hosted Docker environment).
Document deployment steps in the README.
